I'm a front-end developer, originally with an interest in creating UI's for games, and then some how getting involved with low-level graphics performance on web browsers for console quality games.

I'm now highly invested in taking my "game mindset" and applying it to websites, to create apps that aren't just defined as *pages*, but tiles, panels, drawers, sliders, windows...

I'm interested in the meticulous, discovering how different style decisions pan out both on devices and on the public.
