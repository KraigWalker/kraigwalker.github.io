I was at a couple of industry meet ups last week, and more and more often the conversation turns to marketing. That’s not surprising in a room full of game developers, who more now than ever before are wearing multiple hats. Artist one day, Marketer the next, then back to Programmer at the same time. There’s a recurring joke I keep hearing, it tends to go like this:

“Does anyone actually use Google+? Anyone? Anyone at all?”

The room chortles - of course nobody’s using Google+

I wonder if this is the same sort of ill-fated laughter as that of the passengers of the Titanic when someone says “wouldn’t it be funny if it actually did sink…”

Our iceberg however is very different from James Cameron’s. It’s almost treated as the norm to actively ignore the usefulness of Google+ in favour of concentrating on other social platforms - you know the ones. It’s not that Google’s platform didn’t do anything to deserve this treatment. The initial launch design was confusing and restrictive. Once people were signed up to the service, people didn’t really know what to do, and went back to Facebook again. There was a failed attempt to break into the social games space dominated by Facebook, which failed to garner both user interest and developer commitment. It also just seemed like Google came too late to the party, for a while, it looked like Google+ existed, simply because everyone else seemed to be doing it.

Time has progressed however, and the platform has morphed and matured. The answer to the rhetorical joke-question has also begun to shift; Who’s using Google+ today? Everyone.

##So, Then this Panda Came Along…

Ever been trying to find information or a tutorial on something, but wind up at some nasty about.com or eHow site? You’re not the only one. In the olden days, such sites boosted their search placement though using clever linking tricks and keywords, gaming Google’s PageRank algorithm to artificially grow it’s authority on a particular topic.

These sites still exist, they’re not gone, but you’ve probably seen them less and less over the last year or so. That’s because of Panda<link>.

I won’t get technical, but Panda kinda changed the way Google search worked in a massive way. The search engine no longer rewarded sites that were filled with tags and keywords, or the ones that managed to buy links from other sites on shallow blogging networks. Instead, it looked for signs that content was genuine in similar ways humans choose what sources to get their info from.

PageRank is now swapped out for a system called Author Rank. Think of it as a tether between your Google+ profile and everything else you do on the web. By verifying that you’re the owner of content on the web, and providing that content is relevant and original, you’ll be rewarded with Author Rank goodness.

Unfortunately there’s no sort of Call of Duty style XP system or Klout score pertaining to someone’s Author Rank. The precise details are kept a closely guarded secret in Google. The good thing is however you can incorporate all your different profiles, blog posts and web presence across the web and use it to build a more co-ordinated and better looking presence when people are looking for your stuff.

##Interest Generation vs Interest Harvesting

If you look at the Google+ interface today you could liken it to the four-way lovechild between Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr with rose petals of YouTube culture around the sides. There’s hashtags, animated gifs, huge photos, videos and even Instagram style filters and image manipulation tools. It’s like they literally went round the social network shopping mall and picked the best bits out of everything and repurposed them for their own use. Almost like… The Borg…

An interesting difference however between the networks is the way people can reach each other. Due to the nature of Twitter and Facebook, the success of getting your message out to the world depends on how many people you can convince to follow you or share your content. Twitter at times seems like an endless stream of people screaming “Look at me PLEASE!” People’s attention is fleeting, especially when they weren’t intentionally looking for you in the first place, which makes it hard to generate interest, especially when you aren’t an established name.

Google+ makes this a little easier. G+ communities is an understated feature that lets you join groups based on interest, such as “games”, “html5” etc. Unlike Facebook groups, which tend to keep themselves to themselves, posts from Communities appear in your main feed. If you’re familiar with subscribing to Pinterest boards, it’s the same deal. If you have something interesting to share, you can share it with people who are listening, better still, you didn’t have to beg or entice them with shiny things. Result.

But there’s an even bigger prize for the Google+ user, search.

The level of integration that Google+ has into search was subtle at first, and like always has a little mysticism. Initially only opt-in users had the ability to see results that had a connection to a Google+ user or posting, which gives a more visually engaging UX. But for a while now the implementation has been widespread. More than a few companies have gone to their SEO people wondering “we’re the top result for X topic, but where’s all our traffic gone?” If there’s a portrait of somebody with a link to their blog posting, that’s where…

It’s subtle, it’s small, but it makes a difference. Further more, as Google starts rolling out more detailed profiles to be displayed at the side of search results, you’ll see that verified users on Google+ get extra special treatment, through summary sheets and even built in controls for users to add you to their circles. Who doesn’t want that?

And the crux of it is, these people were finding you on their own terms. You didn’t have to create interest out of nowhere, people were already ready to be engaged. Those are the best kind of people to be friends with. So put down your chequebook and stop promoting that cat tweet of yours…

Why is this specifically good for game developers? Well it’s not really. It’s good for everyone, you’re helping Google help you help ourselves help us all. Why just make the world’s information more organised when you can look good doing it. You also really need to consider this as a free leg up if your name is John Smith, or your studio goes by the catchy unique title of ‘Pixel <insert other word here>’ - wise decision there…

To summarize, here's what you should be doing before you moan that community and relationship build is hard:

- Get verified for Google+ Authorship using rel=“author” for individuals or rel=“publisher” for studios
- Start using schema.org across your site alongside Open Graph and Twitter Cards to make your content machine readable, search friendly, and more enticing to look at when shared on Social Media
- Create exclusive content tailored for Google+ (Gifs, Gifs and more Gifs) to make those screenshots pop!
- Use Hashtags tastefully to  categorise your content by theme.
- Add key followers and fans to their own circle and give them the special treatment.
- Play the long game. Over time your web presence will improve, and you’ll do your hard work justice.
- Make sure your profile looks the part, remember, Google’s watching…
- Don’t be scared to link your Twitter Followers to your Google+ post (remember those Gifs?)

And guess what: **It's still hard.**
