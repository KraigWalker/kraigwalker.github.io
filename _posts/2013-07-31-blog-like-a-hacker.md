Oh look! It’s another complete refresh of your website Kraig!

I know, I’m not really bothered about migrating 6 or so posts and reformatting them again.
Progressively my blogging systems have become more and more minimalistic, starting out with a full-on Wordpress installation and now having everything being held in a bare-bones [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) setup

It’s a simple premise really. Rather than having a server churn out posts based on PHP code at run time, Jekyll precompiles sites into static HTML pages. That site is then pushed not to a server, but a git repository linked to a domain name, thus you have your own personal website - complete with backup service - from a mere [Github](http://pages.github.com/) Repo.

It’s not for everyone. You need to be okay with command lines and the closest thing you’ll get to a WYSIWYG is opening up a [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), but by distilling the writing process into the absolute bare essentials, I can minimize distractions one might have if they have a whole suite of plugins and buttons to play with.

I’ve tried things like [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) in the past. I think DocPad is far superior to Octopress, as it doesn’t suffocate you with pre-existing theme and layout decisions, but for my needs it’s a bit of overkill to make my templates compatible. Focussing on content, for me, is a much more enjoyable use.

So yeah, pretty bare so far. I want this new approach to be more about posting useful stuff: *Code snippets*, *handy projects*, *tutorials*, *workflows*, etc. rather than comment and opinion stuff. An opinion is only valid when there is hard proof one knows what their talking about after all...
