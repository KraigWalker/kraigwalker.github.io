Today is kind of awkward. Tomorrow is my first day at **WeeWorld** as a junior QA person. Everyone agrees this is a good start for me, myself included. And while I anticipate it will be a noticeable jump upwards from the environment I’ve been used to for the past year (people!!!???) I’m really excited.

Though they don’t know it, I’ve been a WeeWorld user since I was about thirteen years old. In fact, if I hadn’t discovered iTunes by then, WeeWorld would have counted as my first ever digital purchase: A £3 WeeMee animated avatar for displaying inside MSN.

I remember **WeeMees** were kind of like the creme-de-la-creme when it came to customising your profile. The profile picture section was a larger rectangle than the default square to make space for the scene. Also, the whole thing was animated, and you could even right-click and play different emotion animations and wow the person on the other-side. **Coolest £3 ever spent**, and probably the hardest sell ever to get my parents to part with their credit card details.

It wasn’t until 2010, when I took a serious step out and listed all the games and digital-related companies I might be interested in in the future that a discovered WeeWorld’s development was carried out in Glasgow. I had just assumed, like all big things in tech and social media, WeeWorld only existed as a physical thing in the US - where it’s primary market is.

I guess that sums up most teenagers perspectives on games and tech in Scotland: "*Everything happens just in the US*". At one point when I was much younger and less wiser I thought Rockstar North could only have been the accounting devision or something and all the cool stuff happened in San Diego or New York…

Change is in the air. I’m hedging my bets in a talented few I’ve been in touch with over the years. It just feels like it’s the perfect time to make an impact on the world. And if I can do anything to be of service to WeeWorld. I’ll be very pleased with myself.
